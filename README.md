# Eyesong
***Eyesong*** is an online game utilising the lastfm/youtube APIs and react-youtube to celebrate those fine folk who have been feeding our lowly ears all these years...

Users can play a series of rounds of decreasing difficulty/score value to guess the title of a random song and artist from a chosen decade.

Each "game" consists of 5 songs. At the end of a game a scoresheet is recorded consisting of all the scores achieved for each song, the details of the song and the total score for the play.
